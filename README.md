# A DEEP-LEARNING MODEL FOR PREDICTING THE MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES OF A SAND-BED BRAIDED RIVER

This repository stores the data, files, code and other documents necessary for the completion of the Master thesis of [Antonio Magherini](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/antonio-magherini-4349b2229), student of the MSc Civil Engineering program - Hydraulic Engineering track, with a specialization in River Engineering 
at the [Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg) of Delft University of Technology (TU Delft).
\
The thesis was developed together with [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl/en).

The thesis committee of this project is composed of Dr. ir. Erik Mosselman (Main supervisor, Deltares & TU Delft), Dr. ir. Riccardo Taormina (Committee chairman, TU Delft), and Dr. ir. Víctor Chavarrías (Deltares).

The structure of this repository is the following:
- <code>data</code>, contains raw data (embankments, flow data and satellite images);
- <code>images</code>, contains some images shown in some of the notebooks and description files;
- <code>model</code>, contains the modules and noteboooks with the deep-learning model and other documents;
- <code>other</code>, folder with documents and other files useful for the project;
- <code>postprocessing</code>, contains the modules used for the postprocessing of the data;
- <code>preliminary</code>, contains the notebooks with the preliminary data analysis and satellite images preprocessing and visualization;
- <code>preprocessing</code>, contains the modules used for the preprocessing of the data.

The file <code>braided.yml</code> is the environment file with all dependencies, needed to run all the notebooks.
