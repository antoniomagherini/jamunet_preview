ðŸ”´ Attention! ðŸ”´
\
*The public repository is under development. The data, code and necessary documents will be available soon. For any information you can contact me at **antonio.magherini@gmail.com**.* 

This repository stores the data, files, code and other documents necessary for the completion of the Master thesis of [Antonio Magherini](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/antonio-magherini-4349b2229), student of the MSc Civil Engineering program - Hydraulic Engineering track, with a specialization in River Engineering 
at the [Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg) of Delft University of Technology (TU Delft).
\
The thesis was developed in collaboration with [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl/en). The report can be found on [TU Delft repository](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:38ea0798-dd3d-4be2-b937-b80621957348).

The thesis committee of this project is composed of Dr. Riccardo Taormina (Committee chairman, TU Delft), Dr. ir. Erik Mosselman (Main supervisor, Deltares & TU Delft), and Dr. VÃ­ctor ChavarrÃ­as (Supervisor, Deltares).

The structure of this repository is the following:
- <code>benchmarks</code>, contains modules and notebooks of the benhcmark models used for comparison;
- <code>data</code>, contains raw data (hydraulic data, data from [Jagers (2003)](https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/modelling-planform-changes-of-braided-rivers), satellite images);
- <code>images</code>, contains the images shown in the thesis report and other documents;
- <code>model</code>, contains the modules and noteboooks with the deep-learning model;
- <code>other</code>, contains documents, images, and other files used during the project;
- <code>postprocessing</code>, contains the modules used for the postprocessing of the data;
- <code>preliminary</code>, contains the notebooks with the preliminary data analysis, satellite images preprocessing and visualization, satellite image preprocessing and other examples;
- <code>preprocessing</code>, contains the modules used for the preprocessing of the data.

The file <code>braided.yml</code> is the environment file with all dependencies, needed to run all the notebooks.
